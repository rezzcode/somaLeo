CBE AI Tutor: An AI-Powered Learning Assistant for Junior Secondary Education in Kenya

## Overview

CBC AI Tutor is a digital learning platform designed to support Junior Secondary students under Kenya’s Competency-Based Education (CBE). The project addresses a critical gap in personalized learning support by combining artificial intelligence with competency-focused education.

The platform provides students with guided academic assistance while reinforcing CBE core competencies such as critical thinking, communication, and self-directed learning.

## Problem Statement

- Many Junior Secondary learners struggle with:
- Limited access to individualized academic support
- Overcrowded classrooms and teacher workload constraints
- Difficulty connecting subjects to competencies emphasized by CBC

As a result, students often memorize content without fully developing the intended skills.

## Solution

CBE AI Tutor offers:

- An AI-powered tutor that provides subject-specific, competency-aware guidance
- Student profiles that track learning progress, performance trends, and engagement
- A simple, distraction-free interface optimized for young learners
- Offline and fallback support, ensuring continuity even when backend services are unavailable

> The AI tutor does not replace teachers. Instead, it acts as a supportive learning companion that reinforces classroom instruction and encourages independent study.
